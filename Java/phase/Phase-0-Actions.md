- ~~**2-3 LeetCode problems** (arrays, hashing, two pointers)~~

**Note:** You can take this mock later if you want to track improvement

### 🎯 Project Setup (Week 5 - Not Needed Yet)
~~1. Create GitHub repo for your microservices project~~ ⏩ Week 5
~~2. Initialize project structure (we'll set this up together)~~ ⏩ Week 5
