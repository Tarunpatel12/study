### How to keep context across sessions

Use these files so a new chat can understand your past work instantly:

- Session-Summaries.md: one entry per day/session with what we did, files touched, and next steps. Paste yesterday’s summary at the top of a new chat.
- Decisions.md: irreversible choices (architecture, stack, patterns) with rationale.
- Backlog.md: upcoming tasks with priority and status.

Tip: Keep entries short (5–10 bullets). Link to PRs/commits when possible.
