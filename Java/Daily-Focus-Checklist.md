### Daily Focus Checklist (No-Distraction Routine)

Use this checklist every day to stay aligned with the 14-week Roadmap. Print it or pin it in your workspace.

---

### Morning (15–25 min)
- [ ] Review today’s 3 priorities: Core topic, DSA set, Project task
- [ ] 5-min calendar check; block deep-work slots (Pomodoro 50/10)
- [ ] Turn on focus mode: Do Not Disturb, silence phone, close chats
- [ ] Paste yesterday’s summary (from `@Java/notes/Session-Summaries.md`) at top of chat

### Deep Work Block 1 (60–90 min) – Core Java/Spring Topic
- [ ] Study one targeted topic (notes in your notebook)
- [ ] Create 3 flashcards from today’s learning
- [ ] Do 2–3 short coding drills related to the topic

### Short Break (10 min)
- [ ] Stand up, hydrate, no phone/social

### Deep Work Block 2 (60–90 min) – DSA Practice
- [ ] 3–5 LeetCode mediums (one pattern at a time)
- [ ] Review 1 previous wrong attempt; note the pattern
- [ ] Update “patterns notebook” with key insight

### Admin (10–15 min)
- [ ] Log progress in tracker (Notion/Sheet)
- [ ] Commit/push any snippets or notes

### Deep Work Block 3 (60–90 min) – Project Work
- [ ] One issue/MR per day (small but shippable)
- [ ] Write/extend a test (unit/integration)
- [ ] Update README/ADR if architecture changed

### Evening (20–30 min)
- [ ] 10 flashcards (spaced repetition)
- [ ] 1 theory revision: Java/Spring/JPA/security/microservices
- [ ] 5-min summary: What went well? What to fix tomorrow?

---

### Distraction Guardrails
- [ ] Phone out of reach; grayscale mode; notifications off
- [ ] Block sites/apps during deep work (e.g., Cold Turkey/Focus To-Do)
- [ ] One-tab rule in browser; close IDE panels not in use
- [ ] If distracted, write it down → return after block ends

### Quality Rules (Every Commit)
- [ ] Meaningful commit message; small diffs
- [ ] One test added/updated
- [ ] Lint/format passes locally

### Weekly Cadence (Quick Reminders)
- [ ] 1 mini-mock (30–60 min) by end of week
- [ ] 1 HLD or LLD write-up per week
- [ ] Update Roadmap progress and re-plan weak areas

### Health Baselines
- [ ] 7–8 hrs sleep target
- [ ] 2–3L water; 20–30 min walk/stretch
- [ ] No screens 30 min before sleep

---

### Red-Flag Triggers (Stop and Reset)
- [ ] >10 min on one bug without a plan → create a small repro, write down hypotheses, try 2 approaches, then ask for help
- [ ] >20 min context-switching → close all non-essential windows, reset 50/10 timer
- [ ] Skipped 2 days in a row → do a half-day catch-up with smaller goals

### End-of-Day Ship Checklist
- [ ] Pushed code and notes
- [ ] Tomorrow’s top 3 written
- [ ] Desk cleared; IDE ready at tomorrow’s task file
