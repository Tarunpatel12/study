## 🎯 How to Use

### Step 1: Start Studying a Topic
When you begin studying a topic (e.g., HashMap):

1. Copy `STUDY-NOTES-TEMPLATE.md`
2. Rename to `HashMap-Internals.md`
3. Fill it as you study

### Step 2: Fill All Sections
Don't skip any section! Each section helps you understand deeply:

- **Definition:** What it is
- **Why It Exists:** Problem it solves
- **How It Works:** Internal mechanism
- **All Concepts:** Every sub-topic covered
- **Code Examples:** Multiple examples
- **Comparisons:** vs related concepts
- **Best Practices:** Do's and Don'ts
- **Interview Q&A:** Ready for interviews
- **Edge Cases:** Special scenarios
- **Use Cases:** Real-world applications

### Step 3: Keep It Updated
- Add new learnings as you discover them
- Update examples with better ones
- Add interview questions you encounter
- Review and refine regularly
